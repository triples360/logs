1) OpenToonz video number 5, 6, 7 and 8 completed from https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqazFFzUAPc6if6lKp2Z5sDKcvVND0cP-
2) Created first draft animation!


Next steps:
1) Starting Trees in NeetCode
2) OpenToonz learning. Checkout more videos from the playlist. Once we are hands on with OpenToonz,
   we'll start work on the recursion animation
3) Create freeform videos for starters. This will check its ability to do so and help with confidence to create the content.
4) Create a plan for system design. This shouldn't be too hectic for starters.
