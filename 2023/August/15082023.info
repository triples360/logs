Also discovered Krita today. Maybe something good. It has the ability to create all shapes.

Maybe we can create images and import into Synfig. Use both of them in combination.

The solution to https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/editorial/ was not following the constraints given in the problem. Checked out the first 3 solutions from the editorial.

Need to the check the other ones. Especially, Floyd’s tortoise and hare algorithm one.

Next tasks:

1) Recursion animation for the print(2); recurse() recipe.

2) Understand Floyd’s tortoise and hare algorithm along with the other solutions for “Find the duplicate number”.
