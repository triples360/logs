1) Solved https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/description/. This marks the completion of 'Linked Lists'
2) Created Google account for all the content creation stuff: thesingularity360@gmail.com!
3) OpenToonz playlist found and started watching it: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqazFFzUAPc6if6lKp2Z5sDKcvVND0cP-
4) Matplotlib and Krita are on hold, most probably will be scratched if OpenToonz turns out to be a better option.

Next steps:
1) Starting Trees in NeetCode
2) OpenToonz learning. Checkout more videos from the playlist. Once we are hands on with OpenToonz,
   we'll start work on the recursion animation
3) Create freeform videos for starters. This will check its ability to do so and help with confidence to create the content.
