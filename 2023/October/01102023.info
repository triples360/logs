1) Solved 3 tree problems on leetcode. This marks the end of Trees!
2) Created a final starter video in freeform - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U4C81uDRmvXXnYh5L_hQlxMQWw-kJ4Kw/view?usp=sharing
3) Created a blog - https://medium.com/@thesingularity360 and published the first story - https://medium.com/@thesingularity360/what-is-recursion-in-programming-bdd0a5727da


Next steps:
1) Start NeetCode Tries (Maybe checkout some youtube videos first)
2) Write scripts for the following topics:
   1) Trees, their definition and how the definition could be used to solve tree problems.
3) Continue with FreeForm video creation, be confident and stick to the script.
4) Start with system design.
5) OpenToonz learning. Create scripts to animate on OpenToonz, its time to explore it!
